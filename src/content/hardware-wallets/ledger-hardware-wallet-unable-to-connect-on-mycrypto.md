Sample Error Message: *"Your Ledger is currently in use with another application. Please wait, or close other wallet applications before trying again."*

**Please try the following. This solves 99% of problems.**

*   Restart your computer (Do not be lazy. Restart it FIRST).
*   UseÂ Google Chrome or the [MyCrypto Desktop App](https://download.mycrypto.com/).
*   Make sure you don't have any other apps that connect to your Ledger open (e.g. the Ledger Bitcoin Chrome app, Mist, etc.)
*   Make sure you have browser support turned ON. (This option is on the Ledger Nano S itself in Settings, this setting ensures that the Ledger is able to connect to the web browser)
*   Make sure you have contract data turned ON for MyCrypto.com or OFF for the desktop app. (This option is also on the Ledger Nano S itself in Settings)
*   That you are confirming any transactions via your Ledger.
*   Try a different USB cable
